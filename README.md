# FWI-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to predict the Fire Weather Index (FWI) — a key indicator of wildfire risk — using machine learning techniques. The FWI integrates various meteorological factors such as temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and fire fuel components (e.g., FFMC, DMC, ISI) to assess potential fire danger.
To develop the predictive model, we preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical features (like fire classes and regions), and scaling numerical variables.  machine learning algorithms such as Multi Linear Regression,  are trained and evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.
The final model is chosen based on its predictive performance and is capable of estimating FWI for new, unseen weather conditions. This system can assist in early fire detection and risk assessment, which is crucial for environmental management and disaster prevention.
