# FWI-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to predict the Fire Weather Index (FWI) — a key indicator of wildfire risk — using machine learning techniques. The FWI integrates various meteorological factors such as temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and fire fuel components (e.g., FFMC, DMC, ISI) to assess potential fire danger.
